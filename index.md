## Introduction
Legged motion is one of the most demanding movements in mobile robots. Interest in developing an artificial muscle for smooth legged motion.

## Research Question
How can we design an elemental artificial muscle using foldable robotics techniques that can produce the same biomechanical properties as that involved in legged motion of land based vertebrates?
